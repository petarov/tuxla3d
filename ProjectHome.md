## Instructions ##
Boxes in different colors will fall from the top of the playing area. Your goal is to group boxes of the same color using the control keys. Once three or more boxes are aligned together in a row, column or diagonal they will disappear and the boxes above will fall on their places. The more boxes you manage to clear, the more points you will receive.
